- why capture call stack for custom errors?
- patch vs put
- list the routes in planning
- compile model after the pre or else won't work
- import vs require
- findOne({id}) vs findById
- error handling middleware after all the routes
- error handling programming errors, if reference error, must destructure -- should alway console.log
- sending json with error status code vs sending error
